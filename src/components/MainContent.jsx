        Welcome to the Honolulu Botanical Gardens! Our five botanical gardens are located in unique ecological settings and display plants from Hawai ªi and around the world. Together, they encompass 650 acres and contain a vast documented plant collection used for research, education, conservation, and public enjoyment. In addition to connecting people with nature, we offer a variety of classes, workshops, special events, and recreational opportunities like camping, biking, hiking, and catch-and-release fishing.
